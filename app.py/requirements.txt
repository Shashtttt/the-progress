Edit
I'll analyze your Flask application and create a comprehensive requirements.txt file based on all the dependencies I can identify from your code.


requirements.txt
Code 
Here's the requirements.txt file for your Flask application. I've analyzed your code and included all the necessary dependencies:

Key Dependencies Explained:
Flask Ecosystem:
Flask - Main web framework
Werkzeug - WSGI utility library (Flask dependency)
Database:
Flask-SQLAlchemy - ORM for database operations
Flask-Migrate - Database migration support
psycopg2-binary - PostgreSQL adapter (since you're using PostgreSQL)
Authentication:
Flask-Login - User session management
AI Integration:
google-generativeai - For Gemini AI integration
Configuration:
python-dotenv - Environment variable management
Production Ready:
gunicorn - WSGI HTTP Server for production deployment
cryptography - Additional security features
Installation Instructions:
bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Environment Variables Setup:
Make sure to create a .env file in your project root with:

env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://myusers:newpassword@localhost/progress
The versions specified are stable and compatible with each other. You can update them as needed, but these should work well together for your progress tracking application.
